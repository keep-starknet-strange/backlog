# Preface

## Exploration Hypothesis
<!-- 
What is the exploration hypothesis? It needs to be precise enough to be actionable. Example of non-actionable exploration hypothesis: “There is something wrong with multisig wallets on SN, teams do not keep project treasures on SN”. Example of actionable hypothesis: “UX of existing multisig wallets is so poor that it makes teams manage project treasuries on L1, there should be a way to improve UX to the point where teams would feel comfortable to use L2 multisigs”. Actionable exploration hypothesis leads to project scope.
-->

## Scope
<!-- 
What exactly do we need to build to verify the hypothesis. If this amounts to developing a piece of software, scope should include a rough outline of functionalities and architecture.
-->

## Hypothesis Testing
<!-- 
Once software is built how is it going to be used to verify the hypothesis. E.g. After building Multisig Wallet with innovative UX, it should be evaluated with potential users.
-->

## Architecture
<!-- 
Proposed architecture
-->

## Project Continuation
<!-- 
What are the potential ways to continue the project after its exploration phase is over:
- No clear next steps
- Startup
- DP from SNF
- Internal SW project
- ?
-->

## Benchmarks
<!-- 
Include relevant benchmarks prior to project start (i.e. cairo steps for fibonacci in LLVM -> Cairo transpiler)
-->
